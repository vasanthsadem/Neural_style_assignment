Neural Style Transfer
This repository contains an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch. The code is designed to apply the artistic style of one image (style image) to the content of another image (content image). The implementation is based on the VGG19 model, pretrained on ImageNet, and utilizes a combination of content and style losses to optimize the generated image.

Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
PIL
matplotlib

1)Download the pretrained VGG19 model weights from here and place it in the models/ directory.
2)Update the file paths for your style and content images in the script.
3)Run the Jupyter notebook Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb to perform style transfer.
